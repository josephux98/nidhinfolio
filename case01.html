                            the shoping cart in a better place which user can easly find was a hardest challenge. Give a notification to the user when they add an item to the cart, and it was awesome successfull experiece. Allowing users to edit the cart,
                            link cart item to full product details and so many features defined to the cart section because the goal also emphasised on the frustation and fear of the user while shopping.

                        <p class="des"> AN Fashion App helped me a lot to grow in the UX research feild and designing section. As designers we tend to focus a lot on creating beautiful visuals, how perfect every pixel is going to look and often end up missing the bigger
                            picture. This project helped me to understand the importance of considering business perspective in general and helping me to get closer to both client and final user of the product. The creation of AN Fashion App not only
                            people and problem focused, but also ‘features’ focused. It is essential for designers to learn how pitch ideas and justify design decisions from a standpoint of how it’s going to make the company money, grow an audience, or
                            make their experience better.
